# Pomodoro-Counter-GUI-Application

This application when pressed starts, starts a 25 minutes timer for studies, after 25 min the timer sets to a 5 min break showing a break and then automatically back to studies. 
This smaller cycle repeats until we hit 4 times studies which is kept count of of using a tick-mark GUI symbol and after the 4 times studies comes a long  break and after that the whole cycle starts agian.
To get out of the study cycle we need to click the rest button.

NOTE- The timer's actual supposed timings have been changed to reduced the wait time to check the whole working of the project.
